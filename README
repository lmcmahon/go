# go

This is a clojure based Go (the board game) implementation.
It has a GUI where two players can play hotseat style. It lets you
look back at previous states of the board, and replay from some point
in the past.

Future plans:
  - allow saving the game
  - play over a network
  - load SGF files (the basic UI will only need a little expanding to work
    as an SGF viewer)
  - play against a computer
  - implement the ko rule (I haven't done this yet)

## Usage

Currently, I just load the code into a clojure repl in emacs and start
the ui manually. I will improve this in the future.
